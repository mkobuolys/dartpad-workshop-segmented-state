# DartPad Workshop: Segmented State Pattern with flutter_bloc

In this workshop, you will learn the principles of a segmented state and how to implement it using the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) library. Once you know the basics, the pattern could be applied to other state management solutions, too!

The workshop is available [here](https://dartpad.dev/workshops.html?webserver=https://dartpad-ws-segmented-state.web.app).

## Development

While writing workshops, host the files with a local web server that can enable CORS and disable caching, such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

```
npx http-server --cors -c-1
```

Then, point dartpad.dev to your local web server with the correct port.

```
https://dartpad.dev/workshops.html?webserver=http://localhost:8080/
```
