# Implement `ShapeState`

If you use the **_Single Flow Pattern_**, the `ShapeBloc` state classes would look like this:

```
@immutable
abstract class ShapeState {
  const ShapeState();
}

class ShapeLoading extends ShapeState {}

class ShapeSuccess extends ShapeState {
  const ShapeState({required this.data});

  final ShapeData data;
}

class ShapeError extends ShapeState {
  const ShapeState({required this.error});

  final ShapeDataException error;
}
```

However, when using the **_Segmented State Pattern_**, only a single class is needed - different flows are implemented as class properties.

_TODO 1-2_ - Add `data`, `error` and `isLoading` properties to the `ShapeState` class and its constructor:

```
@immutable
class ShapeState {
  const ShapeState({
    this.data,
    this.error,
    this.isLoading = false,
  });

  final ShapeData? data;
  final ShapeDataException? error;
  final bool isLoading;

  <...>
}
```

As you may notice, the _success_ state is covered by the `data` property, error - by `error` one, and `isLoading` shows whether the data load is in progress or not.

_TODO 3_ - Also, it's practical to add some helper methods to your state, like `copyWith()`. This method is used when you need to clone the current state but only change some properties of it:

```
@immutable
class ShapeState {
  <...>

  ShapeState copyWith({
    ShapeData? data,
    ShapeDataException? error,
    bool? isLoading,
  }) {
    return ShapeState(
      data: data ?? this.data,
      error: error ?? this.error,
      isLoading: isLoading ?? this.isLoading,
    );
  }

  <...>
}
```

_TODO 4-5_ - Then, you need to override the equality operator (`==`) and `hashCode` getter so that state objects are compared by their property values and not the class reference:

```
@immutable
class ShapeState {
  <...>

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    if (identical(this, other)) return true;

    return other is ShapeState &&
      other.data == data &&
      other.error == error &&
      other.isLoading == isLoading;
  }

  @override
  int get hashCode => Object.hash(data, error, isLoading);

  <...>
}
```

_TODO 6_ - Lastly, override the `toString()` method that will help you print a more beautiful output of the current state:

```
@immutable
class ShapeState {
  <...>

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'ShapeState(data: $data, error: $error, isLoading: $isLoading)';
  }
}
```

In real-world projects, it is recommended to use packages like [`equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) or [`freezed`](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) that will cover the required equality comparison overrides for you.

In the next step, you will implement the actual data loading and handle the _Segmented State_ of the `ShapeBloc`.
