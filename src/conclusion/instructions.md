# Completion

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have reached the end of the workshop.

## Next steps?

The _Segmented State Pattern_ could be applied to other state management solutions, not only _BLoC_. You can check the list of [state management solutions in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options), more specifically - a [Triple pattern](https://triple.flutterando.com.br/):

> Triple is a pattern for state management that uses Streams or ValueNotifier. This mechanism (nicknamed triple because the stream always uses three values: Error, Loading, and State), is based on the Segmented State pattern.

_Triple_ is a direct implementation of the _Segmented State pattern_, hence if you enjoyed this workshop - it's worth giving this state management solution a try.

**Best of luck in your further Flutter State Management journey!**
